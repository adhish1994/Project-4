      "Roles & ResponsibilitiesWe are considering candidates for both junior and experienced positions. Who we are The Data Science team based in Singapore has the charter to understand user behavior and accelerate user growth for our platform, especially in international markets. We work on a mix of longer term analysis (such as how can we be smarter about how we send emails and notifications to our users; or how can we measure the impact of various user acquisition efforts) and shorter term tactical work (such as opportunity sizing for certain campaigns). The common thread between all the analysis we do is to seek to have a better understanding of how our users are engaging with our products. What youll do Your work with our large amounts of structured and unstructured data to understand how our users are using the product, and communicate these insights with stakeholders (product managers, executives, business decision makers etc). For more experienced hires, you will own important project areas from start to finish. That work includes defining an important roadmap of data science work and executing it. You are highly technical and hands on but you wear a product manager hat easily to make your projects successful. Who you are  You care about people: You have fundamental respect for all people You are in awe of the ability to understand and help 100s of millions of people  You are great at:  Extracting and transforming data from systems like Hadoop and SQL, using tools such as Pig, Scalding, Hive, Presto Exploring and visualizing data to drive insights Applying machine learning techniques for a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving users, their relationships, their social media posts and their interests.

      "We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains.The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities at MIT, Stanford and CMU.Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Leaming 2.0 project:Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sourcesCurrently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samplesLabeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data.Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller modelsCurrent deep learning models have10 s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are I00x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updatesState-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.Extreme Deep Learning: Training lB neural networks efficientlyThe high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training.Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communicationLanguage technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed modelsCurrent deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and appl ications involving critical decisions.Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of imagesCurrent deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.Job Requirements:PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas: 1. Large-scale machine learning 2. Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised 3.

    "The utimate goal is to predict the annual salary based on the available features. In order to get the target y, I had to prepare for it first, as the scrapped salaries are joined together in a single string on a monthly basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had to split the dataset to 2 on the basis of...(changes to be incorporated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the target is properly defined, we will focus on train set feature X. Since it is a prediction of numbers, my first attempt is to use regression. However,the X features are all in text. So it is time to use the new skill learn from the course, yes, NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we learn is to tokenize the text. What it means is to separate the text into untis such as sentences or words. Then the words need to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm. We call this process feature extraction, also known as vectorization. This is when NLTL package comes in. NLTK feature extraction module comes with 3 very common vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) CountVectorizer: to convert text to word count vectors . 2) TfidfVectorizer : to convert text to word frequency vectors. 3) HashingVectorizer : to convert text to unique integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each have it's own stop word ability. Stop word is a list of words which its meaning has no effect to the meaning of the context. These words are stored in a list, and the vectorizer is smart enough to remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next feature that the vectorizer have is ngram. I put 1 to 2 settings. This is telling the vectorizer to put maximum 2 words together then do the counting on it as a whole. Of course I could have put 3 or 4, not only that the score drops, the 3 words combined don't make any sense. For example ngram=4, \"research capabilities shared sensor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with stop words, ngram applied to all 3 vectorizor, the regresion score appears to be terrible. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did run back and forth changing the param and adding new stop words, but without any improvement. I have even tried to apply ALL the regression I know, example lasso, ridge, decisiontree, support vector, random forest, gridient boost, bagging with all regressor in, as well as adaboost. None of them gives any good score.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is when I realized, it could be due to regression's assumption. For regression to work, the relationship between independent and depentent varible must be linear. I did not check this and jump into regression is a grave mistake. But a good one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I tried classification technique. Same thing, we need to prepare y target. I binned the salary into 4 bins, according to the distribution, so that all class is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "After y target is defined, and apply it to countvectorizer cum lemmatized words, stop word, ngram 1,2, into logistic regression, decisiontress, and multinomial navie bayes. The score highest achieved is only 0.48 from tfid logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As for Question 2, we are supposed to find the Factors that distinguish job category. However, I hit into a serious problem, yes, y_target becomes extremely unbalanced."
